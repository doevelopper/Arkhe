Building GICS
-------------

The build system used for GICS is CMake (http://cmake.org/).

Moreover, the GICS library depends on Qt4 (http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads/),
Boost (http://www.boost.org/) and the Tegesoft's CAMP library (http://www.tegesoft.com/).

CMake will find Qt4 automatically if it is properly installed. However, if you have more than one
installations of Qt, you can specify the right one by filling the QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE CMake variable with the
path of the corresponding qmake executable.

CMake will also find Boost if it is properly installed. If not, the BOOST_ROOT CMake variable can
be defined to locate it.

For CMake to be able to locate the CAMP library, it will need the FindCAMP.cmake file provided with
the CAMP package. If this file is not found automatically by CMake (i.e. the file is not in a
standard CMake directory), the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH variable can be set to different paths to locate
it.

If CAMP is not installed in a standard directory, the CAMP_DIR environment variable can be set to
the path to the CAMP header files and the path to the CAMP library (example: CAMP_DIR="/home/dev/camp/include;/home/dev/camp/lib").

Once you have generated the project files / makefiles for your favorite compiler (please refer to http://cmake.org/
if you do not know how to do it), you can use them to compile the GICS binaries.
 
The following targets are defined:
 
(empty)
    builds everything

gics
    builds the GICS library

simpledemo
    builds the GICS simple demo

apidoc
    generates the API documentation in HTML format; on Windows, if the HTML Help Workshop program
    is available, the CHM documentation is generated as well
         
apidoc_forced
    regenerates the API documentation

install
    installs all the generated components to the standard path, in a Tegesoft/CAMP subdirectory


Installing GICS
---------------

There are three ways to install GICS:
- Running the installer (on Windows and Mac OS X) and following the instructions
- Uncompressing the binary archive to a standard path (C:\Program Files, /usr/local/, ...)
- Using CMake and calling the "install" target (see above)

This will create the following directories:
- <INSTALL_PATH>/bin contains the GICS binary files
- <INSTALL_PATH>/doc contains the API documentation
- <INSTALL_PATH>/include contains the GICS header files
- <INSTALL_PATH>/lib contains the GICS library files
- <INSTALL_PATH>/utils contains various utilities related to GICS
